## Information: 

- <b>PM2.5 (Particulate Matter 2.5)</b>: tiny particles in air that rreduce visibility and cause the air to appear hazy when levels are elevated. A concern for people's health when levels in air are high.

- <b>PM10 (Particulate Matter)</b>: very small particles found in dust and smoke. 

- <b>SO2 (Sulfur Dioxide)</b>: results from the burning of either sulfur or materials containing sulfur

- <b>NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide)</b> primarily gets in the air from the burning of fuel. It forms from emissions from cars, trucks and buses, power plants, and off-road equipment.

- <b>CO (Carbon Monoxide)</b>: colorless, odorless gas that can be harmful when inhaled in large amounts. CO is released when something is burned.

- <b>O3 (Ground level Ozone)</b>: happens when pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, industrial boilers, refineries, chemical plants, and other sources chemically react in the presence of sunlight.
